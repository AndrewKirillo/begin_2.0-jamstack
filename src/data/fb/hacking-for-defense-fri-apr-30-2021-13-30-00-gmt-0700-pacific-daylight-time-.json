  "description": "*Hacking for Defense* (H4D) is designed to provide students the opportunity to learn how to work with defense agencies to better address emerging domestic challenges. Unlike traditional practices that can slow decision making and thwart rapid innovation, this course will provide a proven platform to develop prototypes that meet usersâ€™ needs in weeks. Government, nonprofits and other organizations may provide follow-on funding to these student teams for further refinement and development of prototypes.",
