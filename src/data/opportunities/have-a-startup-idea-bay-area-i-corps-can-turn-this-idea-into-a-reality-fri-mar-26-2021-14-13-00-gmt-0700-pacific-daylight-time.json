  "description": "Have a startup idea? Bay Area I-Corps can help you turn ideas into reality. This one-week course includes three evening sessions, based on Steve Blank's Lean LaunchPad (Business Model Canvas + Customer Discovery), on how to identify and refine Value Propositions and Customer Segments to de-risk your idea and achieve product-market fit. Outside of class, you'll conduct at least 15 interviews with potential customers. Teams that complete this course may qualify for the National I-Corps Program, a 7-week course that comes with a $50,000 customer discovery grant.",
