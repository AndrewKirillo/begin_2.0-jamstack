  "description": "Decades of economic underdevelopment and socio-political conflict have resulted in skills, gender equity, and innovation gaps in a number of countries in the broader Middle East region. By developing human capital, instilling entrepreneurial mindsets, building bridges with Silicon Valley, and publishing academically rigorous policy-oriented research, the AMENA Center aims to narrow the gaps."
