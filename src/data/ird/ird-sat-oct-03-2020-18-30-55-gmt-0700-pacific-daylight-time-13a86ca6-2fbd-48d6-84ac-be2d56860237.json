  "description": "Learn2Launch is held each Spring on the University of California, Berkeley campus, located in the Berkeley hills and overlooking the San Francisco Bay. Limited numbers of international graduate students are accepted to the program, allowing a rich learning environment and frequent one-on-one instruction and mentoring opportunities. Our faculty deliver an outstanding curriculum that leverages the unique entrepreneurial culture and ecosystem of Silicon Valley. The program is hosted by the Technology Transfer Program of the Institute of Transportation Studies and draws on faculty from across campus, and entrepreneurs and others from across the Bay Area. "
