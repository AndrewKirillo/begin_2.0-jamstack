  "excerpt": "With 17 startups participating, [Berkeley SkyDeck’s Demo Day](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/) isn’t the largest cohort [we’ve seen by any stretch](https://techcrunch.com/tag/y-combinator/). The collection of companies is, however, defined by a wide range of focuses, from pioneering diabetes treatments to retrofitting autonomous trucking, curated by the SkyDeck’s small team and a number of advisors.\n\nFounded in 2012, the accelerator is focused on developing early-stage companies tied to the University of California system. Applicants must be affiliated with either one of the 10 UC schools or their national laboratories in Berkeley, Livermore and Los Alamos. Notable alumni include micromobility unicorn, Lime, and delivery robotics firm, Kiwi.\n\nIn 2020, SkyDeck — along with much of the rest of the world — went virtual.\n\n“While flight restrictions did cause some international founders to pull crazy hours from our home countries to participate in the sessions, virtual sessions allowed additional members of our teams to participate that would otherwise not have been able to do so,” the accelerator’s organizers said in a TechCrunch post last year. “We are also hearing chatter that Demo Day will be larger than ever before because virtual events are much more scalable.”",
